# Personnel_Management
This program, named "Personnel Management System," is designed to manage information about individuals within an organization, specifically employees (Employe) and students (Eleve). The system is implemented using object-oriented principles in Python.
Classes:
The 'classes' module contains the implementation of the personnel management system. The base class 'Personne' is an abstract class with attributes such as code, last name, first name, and age. Subclasses 'Employe' and 'Eleve' extend 'Personne' and include additional attributes such as grade and level/average, respectively.

Each class provides methods for retrieving and modifying attributes, as well as a ToString method for generating a string representation of the object. The 'Equals' method checks for equality based on the 'code' attribute.

This program serves as a foundation for managing personnel information within an organization, with extensibility for future enhancements and additional functionalities.
